\title{Denominate a data set within a purse.}
\usage{
\method{Denominate}{purse}(
  x,
  dset,
  denoms = NULL,
  denomby = NULL,
  denoms_ID = NULL,
  f_denom = NULL,
  write_to = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A purse class object}

\item{dset}{The name of the data set to apply the function to, which should be accessible in \code{.$Data}.}

\item{denoms}{An optional data frame of denominator data. Columns should be denominator data, with column names corresponding
to entries in \code{denomby}. This must also include an ID column identified by \code{denoms_ID} to match rows. If \code{denoms}
is not specified, will extract any potential denominator columns that were attached to \code{iData} when calling \code{\link[=new_coin]{new_coin()}}.}

\item{denomby}{Optional data frame which specifies which denominators to use for each indicator, and any scaling factors
to apply. Should have columns \code{iCode}, \code{Denominator}, \code{ScaleFactor}. \code{iCode} specifies an indicator code found in \code{dset},
\code{Denominator} specifies a column name from \code{denoms} to use to denominate the corresponding column from \code{x}.
\code{ScaleFactor} allows the possibility to scale
denominators if needed, and specifies a factor to multiply the resulting values by. For example, if GDP is a denominator and is measured in
dollars, dividing will create very small numbers (order 1e-10 and smaller) which could cause problems with numerical precision. If \code{denomby}
is not specified, specifications will be taken from the "Denominator" column in \code{iMeta}, if it exists.}

\item{denoms_ID}{An ID column for matching \code{denoms} with the data to be denominated. This column should contain
uMeta codes to match with the data set extracted from the coin.}

\item{f_denom}{A function which takes two numeric vector arguments and is used to perform the denomination for each
column. By default, this is division, i.e. \code{x[[col]]/denoms[[col]]} for given columns, but any function can be passed
that takes two numeric vectors as inputs and returns a single numeric vector. See details.}

\item{write_to}{If specified, writes the aggregated data to \code{.$Data[[write_to]]}. Default \code{write_to = "Denominated"}.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
An updated purse

\description{
This works in almost exactly the same way as \code{\link[=Denominate.coin]{Denominate.coin()}}. The only point of care is that the
\code{denoms} argument here cannot take time-indexed data, but only a single value for each unit. It is
therefore recommended to pass the time-dependent denominator data as part of \code{iData} when calling
\code{\link[=new_coin]{new_coin()}}. In this way, denominators can vary with time. See \code{vignette("denomination")}.

# build example purse
purse <- build_example_purse(up_to = "new_coin", quietly = TRUE)

# denominate using data/specs already included in coin
purse <- Denominate(purse, dset = "Raw")
