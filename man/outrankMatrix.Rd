\title{Outranking matrix}
\usage{
outrankMatrix(X, w = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame or matrix of indicator data, with observations as rows and indicators
as columns. No other columns should be present (e.g. label columns).}

\item{w}{A vector of weights, which should have length equal to \code{ncol(X)}. Weights are relative
and will be re-scaled to sum to 1. If \code{w} is not specified, defaults to equal weights.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{.$OutRankMatrix} the outranking matrix with \code{nrow(X)} rows and columns (matrix class).
\item \code{.$nDominant} the number of dominance/robust pairs
\item \code{.$fracDominant} the percentage of dominance/robust pairs
}
}
\description{
Constructs an outranking matrix based on a data frame of indicator data and corresponding weights.
}
\examples{
# get a sample of a few indicators
ind_data <- COINr::ASEM_iData[12:16]
# calculate outranking matrix
outlist <- outrankMatrix(ind_data)
# see fraction of dominant pairs (robustness)
outlist$fracDominant
