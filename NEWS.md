# COINr 0.5.4

* Fixed various small issues that were flagged by CRAN
* New function `extractYear` which allows panel data to be passed to `assemble()` and (optionally) imputed by latest year.
* Fixed bug in `plorCorr()` and `getCorr()`
* Changed `WorldDenoms` data set slightly to only use ASCII coding - this involved unfortunately removing a few accents on country names which is necessary to avoid warning notes when submitting to CRAN.
* Added goalpost normalisation method, as in European Skills Index
* Fixed small bug in `compareDF()`

# COINr 0.5.3
