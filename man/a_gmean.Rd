\title{Weighted geometric mean}
\usage{
a_gmean(x, w = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of positive values.}

\item{w}{A vector of weights, which should have length equal to \code{length(x)}. Weights are relative
and will be re-scaled to sum to 1. If \code{w} is not specified, defaults to equal weights.}
}
\value{
The geometric mean, as a numeric value.
}
\description{
Weighted geometric mean of a vector. \code{NA} are skipped by default.
}
\details{
This function replaces the now-defunct \code{geoMean()} from COINr < v1.0.
}
\examples{
# a vector of values
x <- 1:10
# a vector of weights
w <- runif(10)
# weighted geometric mean
a_gmean(x,w)

}
