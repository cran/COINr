\title{Build COIN object}
\usage{
assemble(
  IndData,
  IndMeta,
  AggMeta,
  include = NULL,
  exclude = NULL,
  preagg = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{IndData}{A data frame of indicator data.}

\item{IndMeta}{A data frame containing auxiliary information for each indicator}

\item{AggMeta}{A data frame specifying the names and weights of each aggregation group}

\item{include}{Optional argument specifying a subset of indicator codes to include (default all indicators included)}

\item{exclude}{Optional argument specifying a subset of indicator codes to exclude (default none excluded)}

\item{preagg}{Set to \code{TRUE} if you want to assemble a COIN using pre-aggregated data (typically for ex-post analysis)}
}
\value{
A "COIN" (list) formatted to the specifications of COINr.
Note that the COIN object is an S3 class. It doesn't impose restrictions on the structure of the list.
}
\description{
This takes the raw data provided by the user and puts it into a list format (COIN object) that is recognised by COINr.
It also checks whether there are any syntax errors in the data provided. Optionally, you can exclude
or include indicators using the \code{include} and \code{exclude} arguments. Note that if an indicator is specified in
BOTH \code{include} and \code{exclude}, it will be excluded.
}
\details{
A "COIN" is an S3 class which is a structured list of indicator data, metadata, results and methodology which is used
throughout COINr. COINs are a convenient way to store all variables relating to the composite indicator in a single named
object. This keeps the workspace tidy, but also allows fast and concise calls to functions, as well as copying COINs to
introduce methodological variations, and enables complex operations such as global sensitivity analysis (see \code{\link[=sensitivity]{sensitivity()}}.

For general information on COINs see the COINr vignette as well as the \href{https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINrDoc/coins-the-currency-of-coinr.html}{relevant chapter} in the COINr online documentation.

For details on copying, adjusting and comparing COINs see the \href{https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINrDoc/adjustments-and-comparisons.html}{COINr chapter on adjustments and comparisons}.
