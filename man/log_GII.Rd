\title{Log-transform a vector}
\usage{
log_GII(x, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{na.rm}{Set \code{TRUE} to remove \code{NA} values, otherwise returns \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
A log-transformed vector of data.
}
\description{
Performs a log transform on a numeric vector. This function is currently not recommended - see comments
below.
}
\details{
Specifically, this performs a "GII log" transform, which is what was encoded in the GII2020 spreadsheet.

Note that this transformation is currently NOT recommended because it seems quite volatile and can flip
the direction of the indicator. If the maximum value of the indicator is less than one, this reverses the
direction.
}
\examples{
x <- runif(20)
log_GII(x)

}
