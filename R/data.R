#' ASEM raw panel data
#'
#' This is an artificially-generated set of panel data (multiple observations of indicators over time) that
#' is included to build the example "purse" class, i.e. to build composite indicators over time. This will
#' eventually be replaced with a better example, i.e. a real data set.
#'
#' This data set is in the new v1.0 format.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 255 rows and 60 variables.

#' World denomination data
#'
#' A small selection of common denominator indicators, which includes GDP, Population, Area, GDP per capita
#' and income group. All data sourced from the World Bank as of Feb 2021 (data is typically from 2019). Note that this is
#' intended as example data, and it would be a good idea to use updated data from the World Bank when needed. In this
#' data set, country names have been altered slightly so as to include no accents - this is simply to make it more
#' portable between distributions.
