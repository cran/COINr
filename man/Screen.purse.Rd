\usage{
\method{Screen}{purse}(
  x,
  dset,
  unit_screen,
  dat_thresh = NULL,
  nonzero_thresh = NULL,
  Force = NULL,
  write_to = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A purse object}

\item{dset}{The data set to be checked/screened}

\item{unit_screen}{Specifies whether and how to screen units based on data availability or zero values.
\itemize{
\item If set to \code{"byNA"}, screens units with data availability below \code{dat_thresh}
\item If set to \code{"byzeros"}, screens units with non-zero values below \code{nonzero_thresh}
\item If set to \code{"byNAandzeros"}, screens units based on either of the previous two criteria being true.
}}

\item{dat_thresh}{A data availability threshold (\verb{>= 1} and \verb{<= 0}) used for flagging low data and screening units if \code{unit_screen != "none"}. Default 0.66.}

\item{nonzero_thresh}{As \code{dat_thresh} but for non-zero values. Defaults to 0.05, i.e. it will flag any units with less than 5\% non-zero values (equivalently more than 95\% zero values).}

\item{Force}{A data frame with any additional countries to force inclusion or exclusion. Required columns \code{uCode}
(unit code(s)) and \code{Include} (logical: \code{TRUE} to include and \code{FALSE} to exclude). Specifications here override
exclusion/inclusion based on data rules.}

\item{write_to}{If specified, writes the aggregated data to \code{.$Data[[write_to]]}. Default \code{write_to = "Screened"}.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
An updated purse with coins screened and updated.

\description{
Screens units based on a data availability threshold and presence of zeros. Units can be optionally
"forced" to be included or excluded, making exceptions for the data availability threshold.
}
\details{
The two main criteria of interest are \code{NA} values, and zeros. The summary table gives percentages of
\code{NA} values for each unit, across indicators, and percentage zero values (\emph{as a percentage of non-\code{NA} values}).
Each unit is flagged as having low data or too many zeros based on thresholds.
