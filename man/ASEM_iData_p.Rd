\description{
This is an artificially-generated set of panel data (multiple observations of indicators over time) that
is included to build the example "purse" class, i.e. to build composite indicators over time. This will
eventually be replaced with a better example, i.e. a real data set.
}

This data set is in the new v1.0 format.
