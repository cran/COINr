get_PCA(
  coin,
  dset = "Raw",
  iCodes = NULL,
  Level = NULL,
  by_groups = TRUE,
  nowarnings = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{coin}{A coin}

\item{dset}{The name of the data set in \code{.$Data} to use.}

\item{iCodes}{An optional character vector of indicator codes to subset the indicator data, passed to \code{\link[=get_data]{get_data()}}}

\item{Level}{The aggregation level to take indicator data from. Integer from 1 (indicator level)
to N (top aggregation level, typically the index).}

\item{by_groups}{If \code{TRUE} (default), performs PCA inside each aggregation group inside the specified level. If \code{FALSE},
performs a single PCA over all indicators/aggregates in the specified level.}

\item{nowarnings}{If \code{FALSE} (default), will give warnings where missing data are found. Set to \code{TRUE} to suppress these warnings.}

\item{weights_to}{A string to name the resulting set of weights. If this is specified, and \code{out2 = "coin"},
will write a new set of "PCA weights" to the \code{.$Meta$Weights} list. This is experimental - see details. If
\code{NULL}, does not write any weights (default).}

\item{out2}{If the input is a coin object, this controls where to send the output. If \code{"coin"}, it
sends the results to the coin object, otherwise if \code{"list"}, outputs to a separate list (default).}
}
\value{
If \code{out2 = "coin"}, results are appended to the coin object. Specifically:
\itemize{
\item A list is added to \code{.$Analysis} containing PCA weights (loadings) of the first principle component, and the output of \link[stats:prcomp]{stats::prcomp}, for each
aggregation group found in the targeted level.
\item If \code{weights_to} is specified, a new set of PCA weights is added to \code{.$Meta$Weights}
If \code{out2 = "list"} the same outputs are contained in a list.

\description{
Performs Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on a specified data set and subset of indicators or aggregation groups.
This function has two main outputs: the output(s) of \code{\link[stats:prcomp]{stats::prcomp()}}, and optionally the weights resulting from
the PCA. Therefore it can be used as an analysis tool and/or a weighting tool. For the weighting aspect, please
see the details below.
}
\details{
PCA must be approached with care and an understanding of what is going on. First, let's consider the PCA excluding
the weighting component. PCA takes a set of data consisting of variables (indicators) and observations. It then
rotates the coordinate system such that in the new coordinate system, the first axis (called the first principal
component (PC)) aligns with the direction of maximum variance of the data set. The amount of variance explained by the
first PC, and by the next several PCs, can help to understand whether the data can be explained by simpler set of
variables. PCA is often used for dimensionality reduction in modelling, for example.

In the context of composite indicators, PCA can be used first as an analysis tool. We can check for example, within
an aggregation group, can the indicators mostly be explained by one PC? If so, this gives a little extra justification
to aggregating the indicators because the information lost in aggregation will be less. We can also check this over
the entire set of indicators.

The complications are in a composite indicator, the indicators are grouped and arranged into a hierarchy. This means
that when performing a PCA, we have to decide which level to perform it at, and which groupings to use, if any. The \code{\link[=get_PCA]{get_PCA()}}
function, using the \code{by_groups} argument, allows to automatically apply PCA by group if this is required.

The output of \code{\link[=get_PCA]{get_PCA()}} is a PCA object for each of the groups specified, which can then be examined using existing
tools in R, see \code{vignette("analysis")}.

The other output of \code{\link[=get_PCA]{get_PCA()}} is a set of "PCA weights" if the \code{weights_to} argument is specified. Here we also need
to say some words of caution. First, what constitutes "PCA weights" in composite indicators is not very well-defined.
In COINr, a simple option is adopted. That is, the loadings of the first principal component are taken as the weights.
The logic here is that these loadings should maximise the explained variance - the implication being that if we use
these as weights in an aggregation, we should maximise the explained variance and hence the information passed from
the indicators to the aggregate value. This is a nice property in a composite indicator, where one of the aims is to
represent many indicators by single composite. See \doi{10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105208} for a
discussion on this.

But. The weights that result from PCA have a number of downsides. First, they can often include negative weights
which can be hard to justify. Also PCA may arbitrarily flip the axes (since from a variance point of view the
direction is not important). In the quest for maximum variance, PCA will also weight the strongest-correlating
indicators the highest, which means that other indicators may be neglected. In short, it often results in a very
unbalanced set of weights. Moreover, PCA can only be performed on one level at a time.

All these considerations point to the fact: while PCA as an analysis tool is well-established, please use PCA weights
with care and understanding of what is going on.

This function replaces the now-defunct \code{getPCA()} from COINr < v1.0.
